rem How to run a Python script in a given conda environment from a batch file.

rem It doesn't require:
rem - conda to be in the PATH
rem - cmd.exe to be initialized with conda init

rem Define here the path to your conda installation
set CONDAPATH=C:\Users\Aidan\anaconda3
rem Define here the name of the environment
set ENVNAME=tf

rem The following command activates the base environment.
rem call C:\ProgramData\Miniconda3\Scripts\activate.bat C:\ProgramData\Miniconda3
if %ENVNAME%==base (set ENVPATH=%CONDAPATH%) else (set ENVPATH=%CONDAPATH%\envs\%ENVNAME%)

rem Activate the conda environment
rem Using call is required here, see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24678144/conda-environments-and-bat-files
call %CONDAPATH%\Scripts\activate.bat %ENVPATH%

rem Run a python script in that environment
python "C:\Users\Aidan\OneDrive - Simon Fraser University (1sfu)\NHL-Database\draft_kings_daily_selections.py"
